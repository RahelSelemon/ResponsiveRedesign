        Redesigning a website of my choice for improved responsiveness as well as efficiency, learnability, memorability, and accesibility!

      <div id="section1" class="section">
        <h3>The Website</h3>
        <p>
          I will redesign <u><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/">federalreserve.gov</a></u> because, despite providing crucial information, its layout can make navigation and information retrieval cumbersome. 
          Since the website is updated daily and serves as a key resource for those tracking economic changes, it should be more user-friendly.
          Additionally, in today’s world, a transparent government is crucial so the website must be easily accessible for the average person seeking to stay informed.
          <br><br>Here is the homepage of the website: <br><br>

          <div class="image-container">
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/website2.png" class="sec1-imgs" />
            </figure>
          </div>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="section2" class="section">
        <h3>Analysis of the Current Site</h3>
          <div>
              <h4>Efficiency</h4>
              <ul>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Spacing Issues</span> – The text is too dense, making it difficult to read.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Organization</span> – While information is grouped under menus, there are still too many categories. More collapsibility is needed to improve navigation.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Key Information Visibility</span> – Important economic indicators are prominent.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Chronological Order</span> – Recent developments are displayed in order, which is helpful.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Redundancy</span> – Some information is repeated unnecessarily, adding clutter.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
              <h4>Learnability</h4>
              <ul>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Clickability Confusion</span> – It’s difficult to distinguish between clickable links and plain text.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Lack of Headers</span> – Missing headers make it harder to scan and organize information.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Navigation Challenges</span> – Users unfamiliar with economic terminology may struggle to know where to start.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Icons</span> – Some icons are used, but they can be misleading or unclear.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Charts as a Strength</span> – Charts help users scan information, especially those unfamiliar with the content.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
              <h4>Memorability</h4>
              <ul>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Navigation Difficulties</span> – The website structure makes it hard for users to remember where things are.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Lack of Headers</span> – Missing section titles make content harder to recall.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Uninformative Icons</span> – Icons do not effectively help users make associations with content.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Lack of Guidance</span> – Minimal instructions make it difficult for users unfamiliar with economic terms to navigate.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          <div>
              <h4>Accessibility</h4>
              <ul>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Small Text</span> – The text size is too small, with little variation for readability.</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Low Contrast</span> – The color scheme consists mostly of different shades of blue, making content harder to read.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
      </div>
      <div id="section3" class="section">
        <h3>Analysis cont.</h3>
          <div> 
            <h4> <u><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a></u> (web accessibility) Issues</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The website has some notable accessibility issues, including <span class="bold-term">poor contrast ratios and very small font sizes</span>, which makes text difficult to read, especially for users with visual impairments.</li>
              <li>WAVE also detected <span class="bold-term">skipped heading levels</span> along with <span class="bold-term">missing captions and alt text</span> for multimedia content, limiting accessibility for users who rely on assistive technologies.</li>
              <li>Additionally, <span class="bold-term">broken ARIA menus</span> lack proper “menuitem” elements, which can make navigation difficult for those using screen readers or keyboard navigation.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div> 
            <h4>Conceptual Model</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Seems to <span class="bold-term">prioritize comprehensiveness over intuitive navigation</span>; you can find what you need if you know where to look for it</li>
              <li>Implies that the <span class="bold-term">expected user is already economically literate</span> (analyst, politician, businessman, etc…)</li>
              <li><span class="bold-term">Archive model</span> since it seems its depth and organization of data reflect priority on robust record-keeping</li>
              <li>Homepage needs a “dashboard-like” model to improve accessibility and <span class="bold-term">guidance for a broader audience</span></li>
            </ul>  
          </div>
      </div>
      <div id="section4" class="section">
        <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
          To ensure consistency across my redesign process, I developed a style guide outlining a template for the colors, typography, components, and other visual elements I plan to integrate into the final website.
          <br><br>

      <div id="section5" class="section">
        <h3>Figma Mockups</h3>

          Next I created Figma mockups that illustrate my website's responsiveness on three distinct screen sizes: desktop, tablet, and smartphone.
          These are annotated with important design choices as well as my intentions for how the site layout will respond to the various screen sizes.
          <br><br>

          </div>

      </div>

      <div id="section6" class="section">
        <h3>Bringing the Site to Life</h3>
          The next step is implementing my mockup with HTML/CSS to achieve the desired responsiveness.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="bold-term">Challenge:</span> Making improvements to the website while maintaining them across different screen sizes!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <span class="bold-term">How I achieved this:</span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold-term">Contrast Issues:</span> Designed a new color palette with a stronger contrast ratio (8.59), improving accessibility.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-term">Better Spacing:</span> Applied effective padding/margins and used boxes to separate distinct items.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-term">Text Size and Hierarchy:</span> Increased minimum text size and introduced more variation to emphasize hierarchy and importance.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-term">Clutter Reduction:</span> Consolidated navigation items into a collapsible menu, replaced multiple top navigation bars with a footer, and limited the display to the 3 most recent headlines instead of 10+.</li>
            <li><span class="bold-term">Graphics:</span> Incorporated more informative icons and added animations to indicate clickable links.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <span class="bold-term">Conclusions:</span> 
          Overall, I believe my improvements were successful! My primary goal was to make the page less overwhelming for users, allowing them to navigate and understand information more efficiently. 
          By reducing clutter and improving visual hierarchy, users can now quickly scan for relevant content. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, simplifying the layout around the economic charts helped present them as “at-a-glance” indicators rather than overwhelming data. 
          Additionally, reducing the initial amount of visible text and providing a “See More” button allows users to control how much information they engage with.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach ensures that new users can intuitively learn how to retrieve specific information and remember their navigation paths using the “Sections” menu and Search bar.
