        <h3>The Interface</h3>
        <p>
          The interface I chose to examine was Brown's printer.
          I chose to focus on the ones in the Scili since I noticed that they got a lot of traffic.
          Students can use this machine to print in Color or Black & White through the MyPrint application. 
          In general, they must 
          (1) authenticate with their Brown account
          (2) select the documents they would like to print using the touch-screen interface at a designated machine. 
          This interface allows Brown students to make print requests remotely and select which documents they want to release in-person, if they wish. 
          Because printing is tied to a students account, Brown can track prints and bill students for the amount of releases they complete. 
          While the MyPrint interface can be convenient, some users struggle with its remote upload process and lack of clear feedback on printing status. 

          <br><br>Here is a sketch labeled the machine's interactive components: <br><br>

        <h3>User Observations and Interviews</h3>
        <p>
            To better understand the user experience when interacting with this device, I conducted brief interviews with 3 individuals.
            I initially observed all these individuals while use the printer, interviewed them, then considered their similarities.
            I asked almost the same questions for each participant, omitting those that weren't relevant to their experience.
            I will include our detailed dialagoues here along with a summary in the next section.

        <p>
          Across all three users, a few patterns stood out. 
          <ul>
            <li>All users eventually completed their prints successfully.</li>
            <li>Many had to switch printers due to errors, delays, or unresponsive machines.</li>
            <li>Users often struggled with the remote upload system, or found it unintuitive, especially those new to MyPrint.</li>
            <li>Even experienced users found the website difficult to navigate due to the lack of printing options.</li>
            <li>As expected, waiting times varied based on print size. </li>
            <li>Payment issues also surfaced, with one user running out of funds without prior warning. </li>
            <li>Users had to troubleshoot through trial and error rather than clear system feedback. </li>

        <h3>Two Personas</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine a "persona" as an archetypal user of our interface. Here I demonstrate two personas inspired by my observations and interviews.
          How might their experiences differ? 
          By splitting their experience into 4 distinct quadrants we can better understand 
          what each one might've found challenging or convenient: <br><br>

          Eddie’s persona is not only unfamiliar with the Brown printing interface but he is already flustered about his test. All the printers Eddie has used in the past require him to physically connect his laptop to upload documents. However, Brown's printers require a more complex interaction between the user’s Brown account, their MyPrint session, and the printer itself. Eddie needs to know which platform he should be using to complete each step. Although none of the users I spoke to were first time users, their observations indicated that there were quite a few features that might not be obvious to a new user. One specifically noted their initial confusion with a lack of options for a physical connection with the printer. Others mentioned that they had only done remote printing at Brown and were put-off by it initially. Though all three users were somewhat seasoned operators of Brown printers, all were using it for relatively last-minute and high stakes contexts. This demonstrates the need for a seamless experience with little room for error or time waste.           
          <br><br>
          Fifi’s Persona is more familiar with the Brown printer interface but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t face her own issues. She feels like the printer interface doesn’t give her enough agency or control over the final product. The MyPrint website doesn’t allow her to choose the scale or resolution of her image so she can’t know whether it’s going to work until she releases the print. The ability to preview her document through either the online or in-person interface would save her lots of time in repeated trial-and-error but also a lot of money. The users I interviewed generally thought that the efficiency of the printer matched their expectations and was relatively fast. However, from my observations, I could see that most of the time they spent during the process was from the overhead rather than the release itself. By being up-front and consistent about the current state of each printer in the Brown system, users can get what they need without multiple tries.         </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This project helped me better understand challenges users face when interacting with everyday interfaces. 
          Through observations and interviews, I noticed how users can sometimes adapt to inefficiencies rather than questioning them. Many participants accepted the frustrations of the MyPrint system as a given, despite its unintuitive design. 
          During interviews, some users were more enthusiastic than others to tell me about their (sometimes subpar) experiences with Brown printers. 
          One of the most important things I noticed was the importance of clear guidance and support in public interfaces, especially for first-time users. 
          Additionally, an interface design can benefit some users at the expense of others. For example, the MyPrint interface is probably convenient for the university by making it easier to track prints and charge for releases. However, as we saw, it came with drawbacks for other users. 
          I also saw how users are influenced by their past experiences with similar features. When those expectations aren’t met, they might feel lost or frustrated.
